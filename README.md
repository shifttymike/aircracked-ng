# Aircracked-ng

A modified fork of [Aircrack-ng](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng) with enhanced features for airodump-ng and aireplay-ng, plus **airmon-nx** — a modern Python replacement for airmon-ng.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theweefies/aircracked-ng
cd aircracked-ng
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
make install
```

After installation, add `/usr/local/lib` to your `PATH` in `/etc/profile`, reboot, and run `sudo ldconfig`.

## What's New in Aircracked-ng

### airodump-ng

**802.11ax / 6E Support** — Pass `-X` / `--80211ax` to use standard 6E primary channel numbers with `-c`. The `x` band character is accepted via `--band`, and frequency scanning mode is supported for cross-band operation (a, b, g bands via frequency mappings).

**PPI / Radiotap Geotagging** — Pass `-p` / `--ppi` with `--gpsd` (or `--coords` for fixed coordinates) to generate radiotap/PPI geo headers on captured packets. Radiotap data includes TSF timer, frequency, RSSI, noise, and rate. GPS information (latitude, longitude, altitude) is encoded into PPI geotags.

**Fixed Coordinates** — Pass `-y` / `--coords` with coordinates in signed, comma-separated floating-point format (e.g., `35.121212,-75.232323`) to embed static GPS data into PPI geotags without requiring gpsd.

**Target Highlighting** — Pass `-z` / `--target` with a single MAC address or a file of newline-separated MACs to highlight matching entries in the AP and STA display tables.

**Locally Administered Station Flag** — The station table now includes an `LA` column that marks locally administered MAC addresses. This is a quick visual cue for randomized or privacy-preserving client addresses, which are increasingly common on modern phones, laptops, and tablets.

**ncurses TUI** — `airodump-ng` now runs with a default ncurses interface in interactive terminals, with scrollable AP and station panes, a message history pane, visible selection/scroll state, mouse-click sortable headers, and a top header that shows channel, effective frequency, active band, and the active interface's kernel-reported regulatory domain. If the channel hopper tries a channel or frequency that the driver refuses, the TUI surfaces an actionable warning with the refused target and rejected count. Press `v` to view active-band channel availability; unavailable or refused targets are highlighted red.
Band switching skips unsupported bands for the current adapter set.

**airodump-ng TUI Controls**

| Key / Mouse | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| `?` or `F1` | Show or close help |
| `Tab` / `←` / `→` | Switch focused pane |
| `↑` / `↓`, `PgUp` / `PgDn`, `Home` / `End` | Scroll focused pane |
| Mouse wheel | Scroll pane under the pointer |
| Click AP or station table header | Sort by that column |
| `s` / `S` | Cycle sort field in active pane next / previous |
| `R` | Toggle realtime sorting |
| `b` / `B` | Switch active band next / previous |
| `v` | Show channel availability for the active band; red entries are unavailable or refused |
| `w` | Write buffered WPA/PMKID records to an IVS2 snapshot file |
| `t` | Tune to a channel and stop hopping |
| `l` | Lock to the selected AP's channel |
| `r` | Resume channel hopping |
| `d` | Run the station logging / deauth workflow with double-press confirmation |
| `c` | Clear the selected AP filter |
| `o` | Toggle colors |
| `M` | Toggle mouse capture |
| `q` | Quit, with double-press confirmation |

**TCP Packet Streaming** *(2025-03-05)* — Pass `-V` / `--tcp-server` with `<ipv4>:<port>` or `<ipv4>,<port>` to set up a TCP listener that streams the pcap file header and subsequent packets to any connecting client.

**802.11ax Channel Width and Segmentation** — New options for fine-grained 802.11ax channel width control: `--ax40`, `--ax80`, `--ax80+`, and `--ax160` set the capture bandwidth to 40, 80, 80+80, or 160 MHz respectively. Two companion options, `--cseg0 <freq>` and `--cseg1 <freq>`, specify center segment frequencies — `--cseg0` for the secondary center frequency on 40/80/160 MHz channels, and `--cseg1` for the second segment on 80+80 MHz configurations. These work alongside the existing HT20/HT40 options and the `-X` flag for 6E channel selection.

**Bug fixes (March 2024):**
- Hardened MAC address parsing and target file reading against malformed input and buffer overflows
- Added boundary checking to HE Operation (802.11ax) tag parsing with proper endianness handling via `letoh24`
- Fixed channel-to-frequency conversion functions to respect allocated buffer sizes and prevent overflows
- Corrected short options string (missing colons for arguments)

### aireplay-ng

**Improved Deauthentication** — The default reason code is now set to 1 (operationally the most effective). Deauthentication frame counts are now accurate to the user-specified count; the previous hard-coded 64-frame loop has been removed. When the interface is not shared with airodump, transmitted frame counts match the count exactly for both broadcast and directed deauths.

**Probe Requests** — A new `-P` / `--probe` option sends directed or broadcast probe requests to solicit AP responses (useful for identifying AP make/model information). The tool first performs a hearability check via broadcast probes, then sends the specified count of directed probes. Interface-sharing caveats apply as with deauthentication.

---

## airmon-nx

**airmon-nx** is a modern, from-scratch Python replacement for `airmon-ng`. It provides full feature parity with the original shell script while adding targeted process management, persistent state tracking, driver-aware mode switching, and an interactive ncurses TUI. It uses only the Python standard library — no external packages required.

### Why airmon-nx?

The original `airmon-ng` is a ~1200-line shell script with a destructive approach to process management (`check kill` wipes every interfering process system-wide, even those bound to other interfaces). airmon-nx addresses this with:

- **Targeted process killing** — stop only processes using the specific interface you're working with, leaving other adapters untouched.
- **Persistent state** — monitor sessions are tracked in `/run/airmon-nx/*.json`, so `stop` reliably restores the correct interface state even after udev renames.
- **Driver-aware mode switching** — known-broken drivers (Realtek 88XXau, Qualcomm qcacld/icnss, etc.) are detected upfront and routed to the correct codepath.
- **Dynamic output formatting** — column widths adapt to actual data instead of breaking on long interface names or firmware strings.
- **Interactive TUI** — live-updating ncurses interface with keyboard navigation, per-interface detail views, and inline monitor mode toggling.

### Requirements

**Python 3.6+** (stdlib only)

Required system tools: `iw`, `ip` (from `iproute2`)

Recommended for full functionality: `ethtool`, `lsusb` (usbutils), `lspci` (pciutils), `rfkill`, `modinfo` (kmod), `nmcli` (network-manager)

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install iw iproute2 ethtool usbutils pciutils rfkill kmod

# Arch
sudo pacman -S iw iproute2 ethtool usbutils pciutils util-linux kmod
```

### Installation

```bash
sudo cp airmon-nx.py /usr/local/sbin/airmon-nx
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/airmon-nx
```

Or run directly: `sudo python3 airmon-nx.py <command>`

### Usage

```bash
# List wireless interfaces (add -v for verbose)
sudo airmon-nx list

# Enable monitor mode
sudo airmon-nx start wlan0
sudo airmon-nx start wlan0 6          # specific channel
sudo airmon-nx start wlan0 5180       # specific frequency (MHz)

# Disable monitor mode
sudo airmon-nx stop wlan0mon

# Check for interfering processes
sudo airmon-nx check                  # all processes
sudo airmon-nx check wlan0            # only processes on wlan0

# Kill interfering processes
sudo airmon-nx check --kill wlan0     # targeted: only wlan0 processes
sudo airmon-nx check --kill-all       # global: all interfering processes

# Interactive TUI
sudo airmon-nx ui
```

### TUI Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k` | Navigate interface list |
| `Enter` | View interface details |
| `m` | Toggle monitor mode |
| `k` | Kill processes bound to interface |
| `K` | Kill all interfering processes |
| `r` | Refresh |
| `q` | Quit |

### Monitor Mode Strategies

airmon-nx automatically selects the best strategy based on driver detection:

| Strategy | When Used | Behavior |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Virtual interface (vif) | mac80211 drivers (preferred) | Creates `wlan0mon` alongside base interface |
| Direct type conversion | Realtek 88XXau and drivers without vif support | Converts interface in-place |
| qcacld control | Qualcomm `icnss` driver | Writes to `/sys/module/wlan/parameters/con_mode` |

### Comparison with airmon-ng

| Feature | airmon-ng | airmon-nx |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Language | POSIX shell | Python 3 (stdlib) |
| Process killing | Global only | Targeted per-interface + global |
| State tracking | None | JSON in `/run/airmon-nx/` |
| Column formatting | Hardcoded tabs | Dynamic widths |
| Interactive UI | None | ncurses TUI |
| rfkill handling | ✓ | ✓ + auto-unblock |
| Driver quirks | ✓ | ✓ (all ported) |
| Channel validation | ✓ | ✓ (with hardware capability check) |

For full documentation, see the [airmon-nx README](airmon-nx-README.md).

Aircrack-ng is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security.

It focuses on different areas of WiFi security:
 * Monitoring: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools.
 * Attacking: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection.
 * Testing: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection).
 * Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2).

All tools are command line which allows for heavy scripting. A lot of GUIs have taken advantage of this feature. It works primarily on Linux but also Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, as well as Solaris and even eComStation 2. 

# Building

## Requirements

 * Autoconf
 * Automake
 * Libtool
 * shtool
 * OpenSSL development package or libgcrypt development package.
 * Airmon-ng (Linux) requires ethtool, usbutils, and often pciutils.
 * On Windows, cygwin has to be used and it also requires w32api package.
 * On Windows, if using clang, libiconv and libiconv-devel
 * Linux: LibNetlink 1 or 3. It can be disabled by passing --disable-libnl to configure.
 * pkg-config (pkgconf on FreeBSD)
 * FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and OS X with Macports: gmake
 * Linux/Cygwin: make and Standard C++ Library development package (Debian: libstdc++-dev)

Note: Airmon-ng only requires pciutils if the system has a PCI/PCIe bus and it is populated.
      Such bus can be present even if not physically visible. For example, it is present,
      and populated on the Raspberry Pi 4, therefore pciutils is required on that device.

## Optional stuff

 * If you want SSID filtering with regular expression in airodump-ng
   (-essid-regex) PCRE development package is required.
 * If you want to use airolib-ng and '-r' option in aircrack-ng,
   SQLite development package >= 3.3.17 (3.6.X version or better is recommended)
 * If you want to use Airpcap, the 'developer' directory from the CD/ISO/SDK is required.
 * In order to build `besside-ng`, `besside-ng-crawler`, `easside-ng`, `tkiptun-ng` and `wesside-ng`,
   libpcap development package is required (on Cygwin, use the Airpcap SDK instead; see above)
 * rfkill
 * If you want Airodump-ng to log GPS coordinates, gpsd is needed
 * For best performance on SMP machines, ensure the hwloc library and headers are installed. It is strongly recommended on high core count systems, it may give a serious speed boost
 * CMocka for unit testing
 * For integration testing on Linux only: tcpdump, HostAPd, WPA Supplicant and screen

## Installing required and optional dependencies

Below are instructions for installing the basic requirements to build
`aircrack-ng` for a number of operating systems.

**Note**: CMocka, tcpdump, screen, HostAPd and WPA Supplicant should not be dependencies when packaging Aircrack-ng.

### Linux

#### Arch Linux

    sudo pacman -Sy base-devel libnl openssl ethtool util-linux zlib libpcap sqlite pcre hwloc cmocka hostapd wpa_supplicant tcpdump screen iw usbutils pciutils

#### Debian/Ubuntu

    sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev libssl-dev ethtool shtool rfkill zlib1g-dev libpcap-dev libsqlite3-dev libpcre3-dev libhwloc-dev libcmocka-dev hostapd wpasupplicant tcpdump screen iw usbutils

#### Fedora

    sudo yum install libtool pkgconfig sqlite-devel autoconf automake openssl-devel libpcap-devel pcre-devel rfkill libnl3-devel gcc gcc-c++ ethtool hwloc-devel libcmocka-devel make file expect hostapd wpa_supplicant iw usbutils tcpdump screen zlib-devel

#### CentOS/RHEL 7

    sudo yum install epel-release
    sudo ./centos_autotools.sh
    # Remove older installation of automake/autoconf

    sudo yum install sqlite-devel openssl-devel libpcap-devel pcre-devel rfkill libnl3-devel ethtool hwloc-devel libcmocka-devel make file expect hostapd wpa_supplicant iw usbutils tcpdump screen zlib-devel

**Note**: autoconf, automake, libtool, and pkgconfig in the repositories are too old. The script centos_autotools.sh automatically installs dependencies to compile then install the tools.

#### CentOS/RHEL 8

    sudo yum config-manager --set-enabled powertools
    sudo yum install epel-release
    sudo yum install libtool pkgconfig sqlite-devel autoconf automake openssl-devel libpcap-devel pcre-devel rfkill libnl3-devel gcc gcc-c++ ethtool hwloc-devel libcmocka-devel make file expect hostapd wpa_supplicant iw usbutils tcpdump screen zlib-devel

#### openSUSE

    sudo zypper install autoconf automake libtool pkg-config libnl3-devel libopenssl-1_1-devel zlib-devel libpcap-devel sqlite3-devel pcre-devel hwloc-devel libcmocka-devel hostapd wpa_supplicant tcpdump screen iw gcc-c++ gcc ethtool pciutils usbutils

#### Mageia

#### Alpine

    sudo apk add gcc g++ make autoconf automake libtool libnl3-dev openssl-dev ethtool libpcap-dev cmocka-dev hostapd wpa_supplicant tcpdump screen iw pkgconf util-linux sqlite-dev pcre-dev linux-headers zlib-dev pciutils usbutils

**Note**: Community repository needs to be enabled for iw

#### Clear Linux

    sudo swupd bundle-add c-basic devpkg-openssl devpkg-libgcrypt devpkg-libnl devpkg-hwloc devpkg-libpcap devpkg-pcre devpkg-sqlite-autoconf ethtool wget network-basic software-testing sysadmin-basic wpa_supplicant

**Note**: hostapd must be compiled manually, it is not present in the repository

### BSD

#### FreeBSD

    pkg install pkgconf shtool libtool gcc9 automake autoconf pcre sqlite3 openssl gmake hwloc cmocka

#### DragonflyBSD

    pkg install pkgconf shtool libtool gcc8 automake autoconf pcre sqlite3 libgcrypt gmake cmocka

#### OpenBSD

    pkg_add pkgconf shtool libtool gcc automake autoconf pcre sqlite3 openssl gmake cmocka

### macOS

XCode, Xcode command line tools and HomeBrew are required.

    brew install autoconf automake libtool openssl shtool pkg-config hwloc pcre sqlite3 libpcap cmocka

### Windows

#### Cygwin

Cygwin requires the full path to the `setup.exe` utility, in order to
automate the installation of the necessary packages. In addition, it
requires the location of your installation, a path to the cached
packages download location, and a mirror URL.

An example of automatically installing all the dependencies
is as follows:

    c:\cygwin\setup-x86.exe -qnNdO -R C:/cygwin -s http://cygwin.mirror.constant.com -l C:/cygwin/var/cache/setup -P autoconf -P automake -P bison -P gcc-core -P gcc-g++ -P mingw-runtime -P mingw-binutils -P mingw-gcc-core -P mingw-gcc-g++ -P mingw-pthreads -P mingw-w32api -P libtool -P make -P python -P gettext-devel -P gettext -P intltool -P libiconv -P pkg-config -P git -P wget -P curl -P libpcre-devel -P libssl-devel -P libsqlite3-devel

#### MSYS2

    pacman -Sy autoconf automake-wrapper libtool msys2-w32api-headers msys2-w32api-runtime gcc pkg-config git python openssl-devel openssl libopenssl msys2-runtime-devel gcc binutils make pcre-devel libsqlite-devel

## Compiling

To build `aircrack-ng`, the Autotools build system is utilized. Autotools replaces
the older method of compilation.

**NOTE**: If utilizing a developer version, eg: one checked out from source control,
you will need to run a pre-`configure` script. The script to use is one of the
following: `autoreconf -i` or `env NOCONFIGURE=1 ./autogen.sh`.

First, `./configure` the project for building with the appropriate options specified
for your environment:

    ./configure <options>

**TIP**: If the above fails, please see above about developer source control versions.

Next, compile the project (respecting if `make` or `gmake` is needed):

 * Compilation:

    `make`

 * Compilation on *BSD or Solaris:

    `gmake`

Finally, the additional targets listed below may be of use in your environment:

 * Execute all unit testing:

    `make check`

 * Execute all integration testing (requires root):
 
    `make integration`

 * Installing:

    `make install`

 * Uninstall:

    `make uninstall`


###  `./configure` flags

When configuring, the following flags can be used and combined to adjust the suite
to your choosing:

* **with-airpcap=DIR**:  needed for supporting airpcap devices on windows (cygwin or msys2 only)
                Replace DIR above with the absolute location to the root of the
                extracted source code from the Airpcap CD or downloaded SDK available
                online. Required on Windows to build `besside-ng`, `besside-ng-crawler`, 
                `easside-ng`, `tkiptun-ng` and `wesside-ng` when building experimental tools.
                The developer pack (Compatible with version 4.1.1 and 4.1.3) can be downloaded at
                https://support.riverbed.com/content/support/software/steelcentral-npm/airpcap.html

* **with-experimental**: needed to compile `tkiptun-ng`, `easside-ng`, `buddy-ng`,
                    `buddy-ng-crawler`, `airventriloquist` and `wesside-ng`.
                    libpcap development package is also required to compile most of the tools.
                    If not present, not all experimental tools will be built.
                    On Cygwin, libpcap is not present and the Airpcap SDK replaces it.
                    See --with-airpcap option above.

* **with-ext-scripts**: needed to build `airoscript-ng`, `versuck-ng`, `airgraph-ng` and 
                   `airdrop-ng`. 
                   Note: Each script has its own dependencies.

* **with-gcrypt**:   Use libgcrypt crypto library instead of the default OpenSSL.
                And also use internal fast sha1 implementation (borrowed from GIT)
                Dependency (Debian): libgcrypt20-dev

* **with-duma**:	Compile with DUMA support. DUMA is a library to detect buffer overruns and under-runs.
            	Dependencies (debian): duma

* **disable-libnl**:  Set-up the project to be compiled without libnl (1 or 3). Linux option only.

* **without-opt**:  Do not enable stack protector (on GCC 4.9 and above).

* **enable-shared**:   Make OSdep a shared library.

* **disable-shared**: When combined with **enable-static**, it will statically compile Aircrack-ng.

* **with-avx512**:  On x86, add support for AVX512 instructions in aircrack-ng. Only use it when
                    the current CPU supports AVX512.

* **with-static-simd=<SIMD>**: Compile a single optimization in aircrack-ng binary. Useful when compiling
                    statically and/or for space-constrained devices. Valid SIMD options: x86-sse2,
                    x86-avx, x86-avx2, x86-avx512, ppc-altivec, ppc-power8, arm-neon, arm-asimd.
                    Must be used with --enable-static --disable-shared. When using those 2 options, the default
                    is to compile the generic optimization in the binary. --with-static-simd merely allows
                    to choose another one.

* **enable-maintainer-mode**: It is important to enable this flag when developing with Aircrack-ng. This flag enables additional compile warnings and safety features.

#### Examples:

  * Configure and compiling:

    ```
    ./configure --with-experimental
    make
    ```

  * Compiling with gcrypt:

    ```
    ./configure --with-gcrypt
    make
    ```

  * Installing:

    `make install`

  * Installing (strip binaries):
  
    `make install-strip`

  * Installing, with external scripts:

    ```
    ./configure --with-experimental --with-ext-scripts
    make
    make install
    ```

  * Testing (with sqlite, experimental and pcre)

    ```
    ./configure --with-experimental
    make
    make check
    ```

  * Compiling on OS X with macports (and all options):

    ```
    ./configure --with-experimental
    gmake
    ```

  * Compiling on macOS running on M1/AARCH64 and Homebrew:

    ```
    autoreconf -vif
    env CPPFLAGS="-Wno-deprecated-declarations" ./configure --with-experimental
    make
    make check
    ```

  * Compiling on OS X 10.10 with XCode 7.1 and Homebrew:

    ```
    env CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 ./configure
    make
    make check
    ```

    *NOTE*: Older XCode ships with a version of LLVM that does not support CPU feature
    detection; which causes the `./configure` to fail. To work around this older LLVM,
    it is required that a different compile suite is used, such as GCC or a newer LLVM
    from Homebrew.

    If you wish to use OpenSSL from Homebrew, you may need to specify the location
    to its' installation. To figure out where OpenSSL lives, run:

    `brew --prefix openssl`

    Use the output above as the DIR for `--with-openssl=DIR` in the `./configure` line:

    ```
    env CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 ./configure --with-openssl=DIR
    make
    make check
    ```

  * Compiling on FreeBSD with gcc9

    ```
    env CC=gcc9 CXX=g++9 MAKE=gmake ./configure
    gmake
    ```

  * Compiling on Cygwin with Airpcap (assuming Airpcap devpack is unpacked in Aircrack-ng directory)

    ```
    cp -vfp Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll src
    cp -vfp Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll src/aircrack-osdep
    cp -vfp Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll src/aircrack-crypto
    cp -vfp Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll src/aircrack-util
    dlltool -D Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll -d build/airpcap.dll.def -l Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/libairpcap.dll.a
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure --with-experimental --with-airpcap=$(pwd)
    make
    ```

 * Compiling on DragonflyBSD with gcrypt using GCC 8

   ```
   autoreconf -i
   env CC=gcc8 CXX=g++8 MAKE=gmake ./configure --with-experimental --with-gcrypt
   gmake
   ```

 * Compiling on OpenBSD (with autoconf 2.69 and automake 1.16)

   ```
   export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69
   export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.16
   autoreconf -i
   env MAKE=gmake CC=cc CXX=c++ ./configure

# IDE development

## VS Code - devcontainers

A VS Code development environment is provided, as is, for rapid setup of a development environment. This additionally adds support for GitHub Codespaces.

### Requirements

The first requirement is a working [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) environment.

Next, an installation of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extension(s):

- [`Remote - Containers`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) by Microsoft.

> The "Remote - Containers" extension will refuse to work with OSS Code.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your working folder:
```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng.git
$ cd aircrack-ng
```
2. After cloning this repository, open the folder inside VS Code.
```
$ code .
```
> IMPORTANT: You should answer "Yes", if it asks if the folder should be opened inside a remote container. If it does not ask, then press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `open in container`. This should bring up the correct command, for which pressing enter will run said command.

3. A number of warnings might appear about a missing `compile_commands.json` file. These are safe to ignore for a moment, as this file is automatically generated after the initial compilation.
4. Now build the entire project by pressing `Ctrl+R` and selecting `Build Full` from the pop-up menu that appears.
5. VS Code should detect the `compile_commands.json` file and ask if it should be used; selecting "Yes, always" will complete the initial setup of a fully working IDE.
> IMPORTANT: If it doesn't detect the file, pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and typing `reload window` will bring up the selection to fully reload the environment.
6. At this point, nearly all features of VS Code will function; from Intellisense, auto-completion, live documentation, to code formatting. Additionally, there are pre-configured tasks for builds and tests, as well as an example GDB/LLDB configuration for debugging `aircrack-ng`.

# Packaging

Automatic detection of CPU optimization is done at run time. This behavior
**is** desirable when packaging Aircrack-ng (for a Linux or other distribution.)

Also, in some cases it may be desired to provide your own flags completely and
not having the suite auto-detect a number of optimizations. To do this, add
the additional flag `--without-opt` to the `./configure` line:

`./configure --without-opt`

# Using pre-compiled binaries

## Linux/BSD

Aircrack-ng is available in most distributions repositories. However, it is not always up to date.

We provide up to date versions via PackageCloud for a number of Linux distributions:

- development (each commit in this repo): https://packagecloud.io/aircrack-ng/git
- stable releases: https://packagecloud.io/aircrack-ng/release

## Windows
 * Install the appropriate "monitor" driver for your card; standard drivers don't work for capturing data.
 * Aircrack-ng suite is command line tools. So, you have to open a command-line
   `Start menu -> Run... -> cmd.exe` then use them
 * Run the executables without any parameters to have help
